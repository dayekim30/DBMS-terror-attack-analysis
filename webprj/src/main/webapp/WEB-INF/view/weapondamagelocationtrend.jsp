-- QUERY 6. Weapon, Location, Damage(FATALITY + WOUNDED): Is there a trend b/t type of weapons most frequently used in each country which has a large amount of property damage or fatalities
    -- Display each region as a line where Y axis is Casualties (Fatality+Wounded) and it is based on Weapon_type
    -- The user can select Time Range and Weapon Type (all as an option)
    -- Same region, different times, and different weapon types
    -- Interesting because we can see for different regions, if there is a trend between casualties and a specific weapon type.
    -- This is useful because if a certain weapon or weapons constantly result in high casualties, then security measures should
    -- be implemented against this weapon in this region to limit the number of future casualties.
